## ...on extending and interfacing HPC simulation tools

**Authors: Adrian Oeftiger and Martin Schwinzerl**

A talk on the PyHEP'20, [see indico here $\nearrow$](https://indico.cern.ch/event/882824/timetable/#52-integrating-gpu-libraries-f). See also [rendered talk on github $\nearrow$](https://aoeftiger.github.io/pyhep2020/) and [source in github repo $\nearrow$](https://github.com/aoeftiger/pyhep2020/).

## How To Use

To run the notebook talk.ipynb, you will need the following packages
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib (& seaborn)
* pycuda
* scikit-cuda (skcuda)
* [sixtracklib](https://github.com/sixtrack/sixtracklib/)
* [PyHEADTAIL](https://github.com/PyCOMPLETE/PyHEADTAIL) (on develop branch as of 17.07.2020)

... and preferably have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed ;-)
